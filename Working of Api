..> we have the JSON, XML, for communicating WITH the different websites.

..> XML : Extension MarkUp Language. { Here data comes with the tags }

..> <employee> 
    XML

</employee> 



..> JSON : JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION: { here data comes with the text }

Json: The objects which are present in the javascript which we need to represent in the text is nothing but the JSON.
.> Light weight data format- because it is a plain text.
.>used to store & exchange data.
.>Language independent
.> can use with any programing language.

the value: may be { number,string,boolean,nested objects,arrays,null}

API {Application programming interface } {here application means software.}

..> API's are the mechanism that enables two softwares components to communicate with each other using a set of defined rules and protocols.

..> So whenever an  software is develoed then that time APIs for that software is developed.so that the other software companies will use them.

..> Private Api 

=These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting systems and data within the organization only . 

.> public Api :
= Thses are open to the public and may be used by anyone.

.> Partner APIs :
= Thses are only accessible by authorized external develpoers to aid business-to-business-partnership.

.> Composite APIs:
= these combine two or more different APIs to address complex systems requirements or behaviors.

SOAP APis: Simple object access Protocol:

.> SOAP is an standard protocol, developed by the Microsoft. The api which developed by the SOAP protocol is called the SOAP API.

..> Security, acid properties,  Only uses the XML data for communication.

..>Implementation process is complex


RCP APis: Remote Procedure Call:


REST_API: 

..> Representational State Transfer: here this is not a protocol but it is an architectural pattern.

..> REST is used for clients and servers to exchange data using HTTP.

..> REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE to access the server data.




..> This is an resource oriented API.

..> At the time point when we asking the data, we get the data from the data base 
here converting data's state in Database into representational form(json/xml) and transfers as responce from the server to client.

..>after we made the request to server{ database} tranfering the data state of the DATA which is present in the database in to the requested representation like JSON /XML is called the REPRESENTATION STATE TRANSFER.

..> rest follows some contraints:
client-server
stateless
cache
uniform interface
layered system
code on demand



WEB-SOCKET API:{ MORE MODERN API in future }
