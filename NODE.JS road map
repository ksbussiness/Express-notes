Functions has first class citizens,

proto type inheritance,

functions
fat array functions, 
function declarations,

avoide:
concurrency
event loop
model of concurrency
variable clorese
for loop to list conversions
dealing with the neasted loops
loops to map, reduce functions

string and arrays
split and 
and strings to array conversions
splice, slice, filter, find'
sorted array to merge conversion
searching, 
hashmap implementation
json key pairs
how hashmap used in the json key pairs.
convert all to upper case, 
convert all the words to lower case,
reverse of every word in a sentence

 palindrome,prime,fibo

calling a function it self

deletation of a string 

captalize the a first letter
