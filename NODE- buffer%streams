This  File contains the notes of the Buffer and Streams :


EX: when we need to send the 2Tb data to the server from the code , but we have the 8Gb RAm only 
so it is not possibel to send the data to the  server with teh help of this 8GB ram. { pratically this can not be done

But we have an options here in this case:
------------------------------------------- >

.> We have to split the file into the chunks and server should take the file in chunk and write into disk at the
same time. For this we need to use the streams and buffer in Node.js

STREAMS: 
--------->
.> Streams in node.js are a way to handle continuous flow of data.
.> They enable reading or writing data piece by piece instead of loading teh entire daat into memory.
.> 


Buffers:
--------->
.> A buffer in node.js is a temporary storage area for binary data.
.> Buffers work as chunks of data, enabling efficient data manipulation in streams.
.> It helps to decrease memory consumption of ypur web server.

.> There are four types of streams in Node.js: 
Writable, readable, Duplex, and Tranform.

sample code:
import { createReadStream, createWriteStream } from "fs";
import path from "path";

const inputFilePath = path.join(import.meta.dirname,"input.txt");
const outputFilePath = path.join(import.meta.dirname, "output.txt");

// Reading the data in the chunk wise:
syn : createReadStream( filePathName , {other options} )
const readableStream = createReadStream(inputFilePath, {
encoding: "utf-8",
highWaterMark: 16,
});

// Writing the data to the file
const writableStream = createWriteStream(outputFilePath);

.pipe(): This is an built in method which is used to connect the reableStream with the 
Writable Stream.
readableStream.pipe(writableStream);



// we can add the event listens:
readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
console.log("Buffer (chunk):", Buffer.from(chunk)); // Convert the chunk to a buffer 
console.log("Received chunk:", chunk); // Loges each 16-byte chunk
writableStream.write(chunk);  // Write each chunk to output file.

// handle stream end:
readableStream.on("end", () => {
console.log("File read complted.");
writableStream.end();
})


// Handling the errors:
readableStream.on("error",(err) => console.error("Error",err));
writableStream.on("error",(err) => console.error("Error", err));
