Nginx is the front gate.

Node.js is the backend worker.

Nginx receives requests from users and forwards them to Node.js.

Node.js sends back responses, and Nginx delivers them to users.

User's Browser (requests https://yourdomain.com)
            |
        [ Internet ]
            |
        [ Nginx (Port 80/443) ]
            |
        [ Node.js (Port 3000) ]
            |
        [ Your Application / Database ]

Nginx works as a reverse proxy to:
Receive HTTP requests from the internet (e.g., https://example.com)

Forward those requests to your Node.js app running on a different port (e.g., localhost:3000)

Return the response from Node.js back to the client



What is a Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a server that:

Takes requests from users and forwards them to your actual backend server (like Node.js) — then gives the response back to the user.

So the user never talks directly to your Node.js app — they only talk to Nginx, and Nginx talks to your app.




There are two kinds of proxies:

Type	Who it's for	Direction of traffic
Forward Proxy	Used by clients to hide themselves	Client → Proxy → Internet
Reverse Proxy	Used by servers to hide internal servers	Internet → Proxy → Backend



Example Flow with Nginx as Reverse Proxy
You visit:
arduino
Copy
Edit
https://yourdomain.com/api/users
What happens:
The request goes to Nginx (port 80/443).

Nginx is configured to forward /api requests to http://localhost:3000.

Node.js app running on port 3000 handles it.

Response goes back to Nginx.

Nginx sends it to the browser.

So, to the user, it looks like yourdomain.com is handling everything — but really, Node.js is doing the work behind the scenes, and Nginx is managing the door.



Performance Optimization
NGINX is faster and more efficient at handling HTTP requests than raw Node.js.

It can handle thousands of simultaneous connections easily (great for high-traffic apps).



Handles HTTPS/SSL
NGINX handles SSL certificates and encrypts traffic (HTTPS).

You don’t have to write HTTPS logic in Node.js — NGINX takes care of it.




Reverse Proxy
Users connect to NGINX, not directly to your Node.js app.

This gives an extra layer of security, isolation, and routing control.


Static File Serving
NGINX can serve images, CSS, JS files super fast.

That leaves Node.js free to just handle the backend logic (APIs, DB).

5. ⚖️ Load Balancing
If you have multiple Node.js instances, NGINX can distribute (balance) traffic across them.

Example: 4 Node.js servers → NGINX spreads users across them.

6. 🔁 Caching
NGINX can cache API responses, reducing load on your server and speeding things up.

🔄 What Can Replace NGINX in AWS?
Here are alternatives you can use instead of NGINX in AWS:

AWS Service	Replaces NGINX Features
Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Reverse proxy, routing, SSL, load balancing
CloudFront (CDN)	Caching, SSL, edge delivery
S3 + CloudFront	Static file hosting (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
API Gateway	Secure API routing + rate limiting
Elastic Beanstalk	Manages EC2 + load balancing (can include NGINX or not)
